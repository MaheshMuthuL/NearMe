The Elizabeth Tower is the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster in London, England.[1] It contains the Great Clock of Westminster, a striking clock with five bells.[2] The tower is nicknamed "Big Ben", which was originally a nickname for the largest bell (named the Great Bell).[3] The tower was officially called the Clock Tower until 2012, when it was renamed to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a Perpendicular Gothic Revival style and was completed in 1859. It is elaborately decorated and includes symbols related to the four nations of the United Kingdom, the Tudor dynasty, and a Latin inscription to Queen Victoria.[4] The tower stands 316 feet (96 m) tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps. Its base is square, measuring 40 feet (12 m) on each side. The dials of the clock are 22.5 feet (6.9 m) in diameter.
